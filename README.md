# Amuse

A chrome extension to manage audio files as you browse through.

Keeps a log of all the audio file sources that an user come across while browsing. This uses chrome storage api to achieve that. Supported audio file content-types are `audio/mp3, audio/mp4, audio/mpeg, application/octet-stream`.

It also makes the list available over a basic music player build in React to run them later.
